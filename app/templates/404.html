                    Project Piscator is a final-year capstone project by 6 students from
                    University of Wollongong.

                    This product is developed using Flask with all the various
                    plugins with a PostgreSQL as our database. For most of us,
                    it is our first time building a project from ground up,
                    everyone was relatively new to the Flask framework,
                    PostgreSQL and even Scikit-learn. Our end product will be
                    deployed on Heroku as a paid Dyno so the product will be
                    free but it will only persist for a short time due to
                    hosting costs.

                    The project ran for about half a year, with the team gradually
                    picking up new knowledges on the framework and other development
                    technologies. It definitely was not an easy journey to make
                    it thus far from nothing (at least for us!), but hopefully
                    it was a good learning experience for everyone looking to
                    jump into software development upon graduation.
                </p>

                    As we are nearing the end of the project, I'd just like to
                    thank everyone in the team for trying their best to pick
                    up technologies they were not familiar with. Not forgetting
                    external contributors that have sent us phishing emails
                    (intentional or not) to train our machine learning model.
                    It has been a long journey and I hope everyone had something
                    to take away from this project. Happy graduation everyone!
